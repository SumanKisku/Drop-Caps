            My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking. He was a medical student working for an immient examination, and he heard nothig of the arrival until Saturday Morning. The morning papers on Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy special articles on the planet Mars, on life in the planets, and so forth, abrief and vaguely worded teltgram, all the more striking for its brevity.
